  // ! THE PLAN

  
  

  // ? Elements

  // Create a 10 x 10 grid using a function that has a for Loop
  // Create variables for grid and cells
  // Create variable for the snake (head)
  // Create variable for the food

  // Create variable for rules and lose popup div
  // Create variable for popup exit button
  // Create variable for span element that updates the points

  // ? Execution

  // Allow the player to move the snake around the grid using arrow keys
  // Make it so that the snake keeps moving in said direction
    // setInterval()

  // Make a cell of food appear in a random location on the grid when the game starts

  // Make new food appear in a random cell after old food is eaten (repeated)
    // Math.random

  // Make it so that the snake gets bigger with every bit of food
    // function with an if statement
    // Player gains one point for every piece of food

  // Make the snake speed up as it eats more

  // Player 'dies' when it 'hits' the edge of the grid or itself

  // A popup that tells the player if they die

  // Start/New Game button
    // - each click, the text toggles between 'Start' & 'New Game'



  // ? Events

  // An event that pauses and resumes the game
  // An event that shows the rules
  // An event to mute and unmute the music


  // * Bonus

    // - each click, the text toggles between 'Pause' & 'Resume'

  // Create portal elements that allow the player to jump to different areas of the grid

  // Player can choose Easy or Hard mode:
    // Easy mode ---> snake can move through walls to the other side, dies when it hits itself
    // Hard mode ---> snake dies when it hits a wall

  // Give the player a choice between 'New School' and 'Old School' styling

  // Responsive design
