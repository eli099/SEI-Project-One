# SEI Project One

## Snake Game

### The Project Overview

To create a game using grid movement through the use of the DOM.
I decided to choose the classic Snake Game.

### The Game Rules & Controls 

- Move your snake around the map with the up, down, left, right arrow keys
- Eat food to grow
- Eat piece of food is one point
- Avoid bumping into the walls

---

### Technologies Used:

### HTML
- The main content structure
- Sidebars
- Main title

### CSS
- Transitions to smooth popup animations and the food appearing at random points on the grid
- Element background colours, borders and shadows

### Javascript
- Tracking `keyDown` events to move the snake around the grid
- Functions to add to the snake array (`currentPosition`)
- Functions to play/pause the music and to play sound effects
